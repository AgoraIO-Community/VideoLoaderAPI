*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*  

## Overview
Quick Switch/Quick Join API is a scenario-based API solution designed by Agora for fast rendering in live streaming scenes. It allows developers to achieve fast rendering and smooth switching experiences in live streaming scenarios.

### Terminology
- **Quick Join**: When a user enters a live streaming room, the user can see the video rendering in the shortest possible time without a loading process.
- **Quick Switch**: When a user is already in a live streaming room, switching to the next or previous room allows the user to see the video rendering of the corresponding room instantly.
